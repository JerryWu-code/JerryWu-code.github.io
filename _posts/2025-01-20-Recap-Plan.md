> The best time to start is now. Never hesitate to do what you want to do.

This is my first post since I started this personal academic website. After reading and inspired by many nice blogs, I decided to start my own blog to record my thoughts, ideas and reflections mostly focusing on AI, Cognitive Science, and Life. I will try to update it regularly as well transfer some of my thoughts in my memo to here, but I can't promise that I will keep it up. I will try my best to make it a good habit～ 😊

# Recap

Doing researches in AI is a long journey and I am still a newbie. I am always curious about how things work, why they work and how they could be beneficial to others and industry. I am also interested in how to make them more interpretable and robust. And in the past, I was lucky to have the opportunity to work with lots of great researchers and mentors and I have learned a lot from them.

# Plan

## Doing Research
In the past, I ususlly spent most of my time on reading papers, coding, and writing papers while participating in ten techical master courses. And I was almost burnt out sometimes but I got throught it and accidently found out that I quite enjoyed in what I was doing and would do. After this year, I realized that **numbers of papers are not the most important thing** in research but the quality of the papers and the impact of the research are more important. So I will try to focus on doing **more impactful and higher quality** research and try to make some contributions to the community.

## Writing Blogs
I admire some researchers who believe in `"slow science"` and they spend most of their time on thinking, reading, and writing. And they hardly blogs or social media and keep inner peace. For me, I thought I was kind of an extrovert sometimes and I regard writing as a great way to reflect what I have learned and thought, as well as a good way to connect with others. So I will **try to write more blogs and share my thoughts and ideas** with others in the new year.

## Learning New Things
I am always curious about and happy with trying and learning new things which I regard meaningful and interesting. Lots of famous computer scientists and researchers are thinking AI is purely **Mathemathics**, **Physics**, **Coding**, and **Engineering**. So I would try to enhance these to be a better researcher and engineer. And I would also try to learn some new things like **Philosophy**, **Psychology**, and **Cognitive Science** to be a better thinker and writer. Besides, I'd love to read great technical blogs and books to learn from others and get inspired, like `Lilian Weng`, `Yang Song`, `Jianlin Su`, and others. And if you have any good recommendations, please let me know! 😄

## Exercising
I was a super sports lover in the past. But after I started my master's degree, I hardly did any sports and I thought it was no good. So I would try to **exercise more and keep fit** in the new year to keep a good balance between work and life.
